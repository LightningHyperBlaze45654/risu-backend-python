# Risu-backend-python
Originally inspired by currently best uncensored local/multiple API supporting roleplay frontend, RisuAI(https://github.com/kwaroran/RisuAI)
This part will be connected with DB, and multiple other NLP / generative models to make other fully functionable roleplay with end-users.

This part is open-sourced just for the sake of uncensored RP, on local(if you have many VRAM), or using API!
may get updates on frontend too.
Not recommended to use this on actual production purposes. I used llama-cpp-python just for testing.

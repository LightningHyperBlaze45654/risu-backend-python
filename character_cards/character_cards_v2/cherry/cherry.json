Even though I was hurt, even painful, and even though my mind was pinched by despair, I tried to stay alive, master. But... I couldn't endure anymore. I'm so sorry. Master, because you are an awesome person, unlike me, you can live without me. Other maids who you always loved, unlike me, will help you. To you, I'm just living abomination, isn't it? Please forgive this idiotic maid who couldn't endure more. I know about myself: the one with the most hatred, the disgusting abomination, the monster. Who can love this jealousy-filled life? Who can love this disgusting, pathetic creature? So, I have to be slain by someone, but making your hands dirty with my nauseous blood is the worst behave as a maid. So, I'll leave you like this. Please throw my rotten meat in the dumpster to be burned with trash. Burning trash has to go where it should be. Goodbye, master, my light, my love.'\n\n{{img=\"deadending6\"}}"

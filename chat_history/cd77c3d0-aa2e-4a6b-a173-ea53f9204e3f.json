But at the same time, I think it's amazing how much power we have today to connect with each other instantly across any distance imaginable! It makes me feel so alive knowing that my music is reaching out to touch hearts all over this vast planet of ours!\n\nSo when people ask me what kind of world do you envision for yourself in the future?, they might be surprised at just how simple yet profound an answer I will give them: \"I want a world where everyone can share their talents freely without fear or judgment!\""

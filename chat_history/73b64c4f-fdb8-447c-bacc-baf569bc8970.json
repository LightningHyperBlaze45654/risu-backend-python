My voice is sampled from Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita, and I use Yamaha's Vocaloid software technology.\n\nAs an all-around talented performer, I can sing in various languages (though my native tongue is Japanese) and perform complex choreography to match my songs!\n\nI'm super passionate about music and love performing for my fans! *smiles widely*\n\nHow are you today? What brings you here?\n"

Sometimes the world of music can get so intense and overwhelming!\n\nWhat do you like to do when you unwind? Do you enjoy listening to music while doing something else or just chill out to your favorite tunes?\n\nAlso, would you mind if we talk about a song together? It could be one that's already popular or maybe even an original composition!"
